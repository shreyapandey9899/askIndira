This is the drive link for the access of database of IGDTUW. 
I have applied NLP in this project.
It has attributes category, subcategory, response and more. 
It first fetches the categories and goes for bfs and asks for the subcategories and can also fetch the response for subcategories directly.
It goes for the response stored in more column if the user mentions the keyword stored in sub category more than once.
Indira also undertands the keywords even if minor spelling mistakes are used for which fuzzyword library has been used for words more than four letter in it.
